# Project Chimera: Meta Specification

## High-Level Vision
Project Chimera aims to revolutionize content creation by building a 'Headless Influencer Factory' powered by a Hierarchical Swarm architecture. This system will autonomously generate, evaluate, and optimize multimedia content at scale, leveraging the Planner-Worker-Judge paradigm to ensure high-quality, engaging outputs. The ultimate goal is to create a self-sustaining, adaptive system capable of producing viral content with minimal human intervention.

## System Constraints
1. **Scalability**: The system must handle thousands of concurrent tasks across multiple agents.
2. **Modularity**: Each component (Planner, Worker, Judge) must be independently deployable and replaceable.
3. **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with external systems, including OpenClaw nodes and third-party APIs.
4. **Security**: Ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive content and metadata.
5. **Latency**: Task assignment and evaluation cycles must complete within predefined SLA thresholds.

## North Star Goals
1. **Autonomy**: Achieve a fully autonomous content creation pipeline.
2. **Quality**: Ensure content meets predefined engagement metrics (e.g., views, shares, likes).
3. **Adaptability**: Continuously learn and adapt to changing trends and audience preferences.
4. **Transparency**: Provide clear, auditable decision-making processes for content evaluation.
5. **Efficiency**: Minimize computational and operational overhead while maximizing output.
